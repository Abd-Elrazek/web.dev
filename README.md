# web.dev

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/GoogleChrome/web.dev.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/GoogleChrome/web.dev)

web.dev is the ultimate resource for developers of all backgrounds to learn,
create, and solve on the web. It's meant to not only educate developers, but
help them apply what they've learned to any site they work on, be it personal or
business.

Note: this repo contains the written content for web.dev. The actual front-end
(CSS,JS) is not yet open source.
